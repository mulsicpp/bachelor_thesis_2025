# Bachelor Thesis 2025

With this project we want to explore hardware-accelerated raytracing in dynamic environments. We want to test its capabilities and limitations:

- How often can we rebuild/alter the acceleration structure?
- How large is a scene allowed to be?
- How many dynamic objects are possible?
